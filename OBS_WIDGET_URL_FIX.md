# OBS Widget URL Fix

## Issue Description

The OBS settings page was experiencing two main problems:

1. **Widget URL was empty**: Users couldn't see the widget URL needed for OBS integration
2. **Access control**: The `/obs-settings` route was restricted to streamers and admins only
3. **Security vulnerability**: Donors could access the page before being blocked at the API level

## Root Causes

1. **Missing OBS Settings**: The frontend was calling `/api/obs-settings` which calls the backend `/obs-settings/my-widget-url` endpoint, but this endpoint fails if no OBS settings exist for the user.

2. **No Automatic Creation**: The system didn't automatically create OBS settings for new users, requiring manual creation.

3. **Poor Error Handling**: Users didn't get clear feedback about why they couldn't access OBS settings.

4. **Frontend Security Gap**: The page was accessible to all authenticated users, with role checking only happening at the API level.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Frontend API Route (`/api/obs-settings`)

- **Automatic Creation**: If OBS settings don't exist, the API automatically creates them with sensible defaults
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages for different failure scenarios
- **Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. Improved User Interface

- **Access Denied Message**: Clear message when users don't have permission
- **Error Display**: Shows specific error messages for other issues
- **User Guidance**: Provides next steps for users who encounter issues
- **Role Information**: Shows the user's current role in access denied messages

### 3. **NEW: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- **Frontend Role Checking**: User roles are verified before the page loads
- **Early Access Denial**: Donors see access denied immediately, not after page load
- **User Profile API**: New `/api/auth/profile` endpoint to fetch user role information
- **Security Documentation**: Clear comments explaining the security model

### 4. Default OBS Settings

When creating OBS settings automatically, the system provides:

- **Image Settings**: 300x200 with shadow effects
- **Sound Settings**: 80% volume, no fade effects
- **Animation Settings**: Fade animation with 500ms duration
- **Style Settings**: Dark theme with green accents
- **Position Settings**: Top-left positioning, responsive design
- **Display Settings**: 5-second duration with auto-hide

## Security Model

### Role-Based Access Control

```typescript
// Define allowed roles for OBS settings
const ALLOWED_ROLES = ['streamer', 'admin'];

// Check user role before rendering page content
if (!ALLOWED_ROLES.includes(userData.role)) {
  setAccessDenied(true);
  setErrorMessage(`Access denied. Your current role is: ${userData.role}.`);
  return;
}
```

### Access Flow

1. **User visits** `/dashboard/obs-settings`
2. **Frontend checks** authentication token
3. **Frontend fetches** user profile to verify role
4. **If role allowed** → Fetch OBS settings and render page
5. **If role denied** → Show access denied message immediately
6. **Backend also enforces** role restrictions at the API level

### Security Benefits

- **Prevents page content exposure** to unauthorized users
- **Reduces unnecessary API calls** from unauthorized users
- **Clear user feedback** about why access is denied
- **Defense in depth** with both frontend and backend security

## How It Works

1. **User visits** `/dashboard/obs-settings`
2. **Frontend checks** user role via `/api/auth/profile`
3. **If role allowed**: Proceeds to fetch OBS settings
4. **If OBS settings don't exist**: Automatically creates them with defaults
5. **Returns** the complete OBS settings including widget URL
6. **If role denied**: Shows access denied message immediately

## Testing the Fix

### Prerequisites

1. **Backend running** on port 3001 (or set `BACKEND_URL` environment variable)
2. **Frontend running** on port 3000
3. **User authenticated** with appropriate role
4. **Backend environment** has `FRONTEND_URL` set correctly

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Streamer/Admin User (Should Work)
1. **Login** as a streamer or admin user
2. **Navigate** to `/dashboard/obs-settings`
3. **Check browser console** for API logs
4. **Verify** widget URL is displayed (not empty)

#### 2. Donor User (Should Be Blocked)
1. **Login** as a donor user
2. **Navigate** to `/dashboard/obs-settings`
3. **Verify** access denied message appears immediately
4. **Check** that no OBS settings API calls are made

#### 3. New Streamer User (Should Auto-Create)
1. **Login** as a new streamer user
2. **Navigate** to `/dashboard/obs-settings`
3. **Verify** OBS settings are created automatically
4. **Check** widget URL appears after creation

### Expected Behavior

- **Streamers/Admins**: Full access to OBS settings
- **Donors**: Immediate access denied message
- **New streamers**: Automatic OBS settings creation
- **API errors**: Helpful error messages with next steps

## Environment Variables

### Backend Required

```bash
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or your production frontend URL
```

### Frontend Required

```bash
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001  # or your production backend URL
```

## API Endpoints Used

- **GET** `/api/auth/profile` - Get user profile and role information
- **GET** `/api/obs-settings` - Fetch/create OBS settings and get widget URL
- **POST** `/api/obs-settings` - Manually create OBS settings
- **Backend** `/auth/profile` - Get user profile from backend
- **Backend** `/obs-settings/my-widget-url` - Get widget URL for current user
- **Backend** `/obs-settings` - Create new OBS settings

## Troubleshooting

### Widget URL Still Empty

1. **Check backend logs** for OBS settings creation
2. **Verify** `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable is set
3. **Check** user has streamer/admin role
4. **Verify** backend is accessible from frontend

### Access Denied Errors

1. **Confirm** user role is streamer or admin
2. **Check** authentication token is valid
3. **Verify** backend role-based access control is working
4. **Check** `/api/auth/profile` endpoint is working

### API Creation Fails

1. **Check** backend database connection
2. **Verify** required backend services are running
3. **Check** backend logs for specific error messages

### Role Checking Issues

1. **Verify** `/api/auth/profile` endpoint exists and works
2. **Check** backend auth service is running
3. **Verify** user tokens contain valid role information

## Future Improvements

1. **User Role Management**: Allow users to request streamer role
2. **Settings Templates**: Provide multiple default configurations
3. **Migration Tool**: Help existing users migrate to new system
4. **Analytics**: Track OBS settings usage and success rates
5. **Enhanced RBAC**: More granular role permissions
6. **Role Upgrade Flow**: Self-service role upgrade for eligible users
