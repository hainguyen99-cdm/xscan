## Components

### DonationPage Component

The main component that renders the complete donation experience:

- **Props**: `DonationLink` object and submission handler
- **State Management**: Form data, validation, loading states
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid-based layout that adapts to screen size
- **Form Handling**: Complete form submission with error handling

### Toast Notification System

A global notification system for user feedback:

- **Types**: Success, error, warning, info
- **Auto-dismiss**: Configurable duration with manual close option
- **Global Access**: Available throughout the application
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Routes

### `/donation-[stageName]`
Dynamic route for individual donation pages based on streamer's stage name:
- Fetches donation link data by stage name
- Renders the donation page
- Handles loading and error states
- Stage name is configured by streamer on their profile page

**Example URLs:**
- `/donation-gamingpro` - For a streamer with stage name "gamingpro"
- `/donation-musicstar` - For a streamer with stage name "musicstar"
- `/donation-artist123` - For a streamer with stage name "artist123"

## API Integration

### Required Endpoints

The donation page requires the following API endpoints to be implemented:

1. **GET `/api/donation-links/stage/{stageName}`**
   - Fetches donation link data by stage name
   - Returns `DonationLink` object or 404 if not found

2. **POST `/api/donations`**
   - Submits donation form data
   - Processes payment and creates donation record
   - Returns success/error response

### Data Flow

1. **Page Load**: Fetches donation link data using stage name from URL
2. **Form Submission**: Submits donation data to API
3. **Success Handling**: Shows success message and resets form
4. **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate error messages

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Navigate to a donation page** (e.g., `/donation-teststreamer`)
2. **Test all features:**
   - Select different donation amounts
   - Enter custom amounts
   - Add messages
   - Toggle anonymous donations
   - Select payment methods
   - Test social media sharing
   - Copy donation page link
   - Submit donations

### Development Testing

For development purposes, you can:
- Set up mock API responses
- Use browser dev tools to test responsive design
- Test form validation and error handling
- Verify accessibility features

## Responsive Design

### Mobile (< 640px)

## Implementation Requirements

### Backend Integration
- **Donation Link API**: Endpoint to fetch donation link by stage name

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Toast Notifications Not Showing**
   - Ensure `ToastContainer` is in the root layout
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Responsive Issues**
   - Test with browser dev tools
   - Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured

3. **Form Submission Errors**
   - Check network tab for API calls
   - Verify form validation logic

4. **Page Not Found Errors**
   - Verify stage name is correctly configured in streamer profile
   - Check API endpoint for donation link retrieval

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```typescript
console.log('Form data:', formData);
console.log('Donation link:', donationLink);
console.log('Stage name:', params.stageName);
```

## Contributing

When modifying the donation page:

1. **Maintain Responsiveness**: Test on all screen sizes
2. **Preserve Accessibility**: Keep ARIA labels and keyboard support
3. **Update Types**: Modify TypeScript interfaces as needed
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all features work correctly
5. **Document Changes**: Update this README with new features
6. **API Integration**: Ensure backend endpoints are properly implemented

## Conclusion

The donation page frontend implementation successfully meets all requirements from Task ID 4, Step 3. It provides a professional, user-friendly experience that encourages donations while maintaining high standards for accessibility and responsiveness.

The implementation uses a stage name-based routing system where streamers can configure their donation page URL through their profile settings. This approach provides clean, memorable URLs that are easy to share and promote.

The implementation is production-ready and can be easily extended with additional features as the platform evolves.
