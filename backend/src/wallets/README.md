# Wallets Module - Transaction Implementation

This module provides comprehensive wallet and transaction management functionality for the Task Master application.

## Overview

The wallets module handles:
- Wallet creation and management
- Fund operations (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)
- Donation processing
- Fee management
- Transaction tracking and history
- Transaction statistics and reporting

## Transaction Types

The system supports the following transaction types:

### 1. **Deposits** (`deposit`)
- Adding funds to a wallet
- Positive amount transactions
- Updates wallet balance and total deposits

### 2. **Withdrawals** (`withdrawal`)
- Removing funds from a wallet
- Negative amount transactions
- Updates wallet balance and total withdrawals

### 3. **Transfers** (`transfer`)
- Moving funds between wallets
- Creates two linked transactions (debit/credit)
- Updates both wallet balances

### 4. **Donations** (`donation`)
- Sending funds to another user's wallet
- Creates two linked transactions
- Prevents self-donations
- Updates both wallet balances

### 5. **Fees** (`fee`)
- Service charges and transaction fees
- Negative amount transactions
- Updates wallet balance and total fees
- Tracks fee types for categorization

## API Endpoints

### Wallet Management
- `POST /wallets` - Create new wallet
- `GET /wallets/:id` - Get wallet by ID
- `GET /wallets/user/:userId` - Get user's wallets
- `PUT /wallets/:id/deactivate` - Deactivate wallet
- `PUT /wallets/:id/reactivate` - Reactivate wallet

### Fund Operations
- `POST /wallets/:id/add-funds` - Add funds to wallet
- `POST /wallets/:id/withdraw-funds` - Withdraw funds from wallet
- `POST /wallets/:id/transfer-funds` - Transfer funds between wallets

### Transaction Operations
- `POST /wallets/:id/process-donation` - Process donation to another user
- `POST /wallets/:id/process-fee` - Process fee transaction
- `GET /wallets/:id/transactions` - Get transaction history
- `GET /wallets/:id/transactions/:transactionId` - Get specific transaction
- `GET /wallets/:id/transactions/type/:type` - Get transactions by type
- `GET /wallets/:id/transaction-stats` - Get transaction statistics

## Data Models

### Wallet Schema
```typescript
{
  userId: string;
  currency: string;
  balance: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  totalDeposits: number;
  totalWithdrawals: number;
  totalFees: number;
  lastTransactionAt: Date;
  transactionHistory: string[];
}
```

### Transaction Schema
```typescript
{
  walletId: string;
  type: 'deposit' | 'withdrawal' | 'transfer' | 'donation' | 'fee';
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  description?: string;
  reference: string;
  fee?: number;
  feeType?: string;
  processedAt: Date;
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Transaction References**
Each transaction gets a unique reference:
- Deposits: `DEP_<timestamp>_<random>`
- Withdrawals: `WTH_<timestamp>_<random>`
- Transfers: `TRF_<timestamp>_<random>`
- Donations: `DON_<timestamp>_<random>`
- Fees: `FEE_<timestamp>_<random>`

### 2. **Balance Validation**
- Prevents negative balances
- Validates sufficient funds before operations
- Maintains data integrity

### 3. **Transaction History**
- Tracks all wallet operations
- Maintains chronological order
- Supports pagination and filtering

### 4. **Fee Management**
- Supports different fee types
- Tracks total fees per wallet
- Prevents insufficient funds for fees

### 5. **Donation System**
- Secure cross-user fund transfers
- Prevents self-donations
- Maintains transaction audit trail

## Business Logic

### Fund Operations
1. **Validation**: Check wallet status and sufficient funds
2. **Balance Update**: Modify wallet balance
3. **Transaction Creation**: Create transaction record
4. **History Update**: Add transaction to wallet history
5. **Statistics Update**: Update relevant totals

### Donation Processing
1. **Validation**: Check both wallets exist and are active
2. **Self-Donation Check**: Prevent donating to own wallet
3. **Fund Transfer**: Debit source, credit destination
4. **Transaction Records**: Create linked transactions
5. **Balance Updates**: Update both wallet balances

### Fee Processing
1. **Validation**: Check sufficient funds for fee
2. **Fee Deduction**: Subtract fee from balance
3. **Transaction Record**: Create fee transaction
4. **Statistics Update**: Update total fees

## Error Handling

The module includes comprehensive error handling:
- `BadRequestException`: Invalid operations (insufficient funds, inactive wallet)
- `NotFoundException`: Wallet or transaction not found
- `ConflictException`: Duplicate operations or invalid states

## Testing

The module includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for all service methods
- Controller endpoint testing
- Edge case validation
- Error scenario testing

## Security Features

- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- User can only access their own wallets
- Transaction validation prevents unauthorized operations
- Audit trail for all financial operations

## Performance Considerations

- Pagination for transaction history
- Indexed database queries
- Efficient aggregation for statistics
- Optimized balance calculations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Multi-currency support
- Transaction batching
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Webhook notifications
- Integration with external payment processors
