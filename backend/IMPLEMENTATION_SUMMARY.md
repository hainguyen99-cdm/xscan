### Bulk Operations
- `POST /donations/links/bulk` - Create multiple donation links
- `DELETE /donations/links/bulk` - Delete multiple donation links

### Page Customization
- `PUT /donations/links/:id/theme` - Update theme customization
- `PUT /donations/links/:id/social-media` - Update social media links

### Enhanced Management

- `GET /donations/links/url/:customUrl` - Find by custom URL
- `GET /donations/links/:id/social-share` - Get social sharing data
- `POST /donations/links/:id/analytics/event` - Track analytics events

### Enhanced Listing
- `GET /donations/links` - Enhanced with pagination and filtering
- `GET /donations/links/featured` - Get featured donation links

## Service Methods Added

### Core Service Methods
- `createBulkDonationLinks()` - Bulk creation with error handling
- `deleteBulkDonationLinks()` - Bulk deletion with validation
- `updateDonationLinkTheme()` - Theme customization updates
- `updateDonationLinkSocialMedia()` - Social media updates
- `toggleDonationLinkFeatured()` - Featured status management
- `regenerateQRCode()` - QR code regeneration
- `generateQRCodeBuffer()` - High-resolution QR code generation
- `getSocialShareData()` - Social media optimization
- `trackAnalyticsEvent()` - Custom analytics tracking

### Enhanced Existing Methods
- `findAllDonationLinks()` - Added pagination and filtering
- `findDonationLinkByCustomUrl()` - New lookup method

## DTOs Added/Enhanced

### New DTOs
- `UpdateThemeDto` - For theme updates
- `UpdateSocialMediaDto` - For social media updates
- `AnalyticsEventDto` - For analytics events

### Enhanced DTOs
- `UpdateDonationLinkDto` - Extended with new fields

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Added comprehensive tests for all new service methods
- Tested error handling and edge cases
- Verified proper validation and error responses
- All tests passing (22/22)

### Test Categories
- Bulk operations testing
- QR code functionality testing
- Theme and social media updates
- Analytics event tracking
- Error handling scenarios

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Proper error handling with specific exception types
- Type-safe DTOs with validation
- Consistent API response format
- Proper MongoDB ObjectId handling
- Enhanced Swagger documentation

### Performance
- Efficient bulk operations
- Optimized database queries
- Proper indexing considerations
- Pagination support for large datasets

### Security
- Role-based access control maintained
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper authentication guards
- Streamer ownership verification

## Next Steps

The implementation of step 2 is now complete. The next steps would be:
1. **Frontend Integration**: Implement the frontend components to use these new endpoints
2. **Testing**: End-to-end testing of the complete donation link system
3. **Documentation**: API documentation and user guides
4. **Deployment**: Production deployment and monitoring
