**Narration**: 
"Hey streamers! Want to add professional donation alerts to your OBS stream? In this tutorial, I'll show you how to set up our donation alert widget in OBS Studio in just a few minutes. Let's get started!"

### Prerequisites (0:30 - 1:00)
**Visual**: Show dashboard login and navigation
**Narration**:
"First, make sure you have an active streamer account and OBS Studio installed. You'll also need a stable internet connection for the real-time alerts to work properly."

### Step 1: Getting Your Widget URL (1:00 - 2:00)
**Visual**: 
- Log into dashboard
- Navigate to Settings â†’ OBS Integration
- Show widget URL section
- Copy the URL
**Narration**:
"Log into your streamer dashboard and navigate to Settings, then OBS Integration. Here you'll find your unique widget URL. This URL contains a secure token that connects your OBS to our alert system. Copy this URL - you'll need it for the next step."

### Step 2: Adding Browser Source to OBS (2:00 - 4:00)
**Visual**:
- Open OBS Studio
- Show Sources panel
- Click + button
- Select Browser
- Name it "Donation Alerts"
- Paste widget URL
- Set dimensions (1920x1080)
- Show advanced settings
**Narration**:
"Now open OBS Studio. In the Sources panel, click the plus button and select Browser. Name it 'Donation Alerts' and paste your widget URL. Set the width to 1920 and height to 1080 to match your canvas. I recommend checking 'Shutdown source when not visible' for better performance and 'Refresh browser when scene becomes active' for reliability."

### Step 3: Positioning and Testing (4:00 - 5:30)
**Visual**:
- Drag browser source to desired position
- Resize as needed
- Show layer order
- Go back to dashboard
- Click Test Alert
- Show alert appearing in OBS
**Narration**:
"Position the browser source where you want your alerts to appear. Make sure it's above other sources in the layer order so alerts are visible. Now let's test it! Go back to your dashboard and click the Test Alert button. You should see a test alert appear in your OBS preview."

### Step 4: Customization Options (5:30 - 7:00)
**Visual**:
- Show different themes (dark/light)
- Demonstrate different animations
- Show URL parameters
- Test different configurations
**Narration**:
"You can customize your alerts by adding parameters to your widget URL. Add '?theme=light' for a light theme, '?animation=slide' for slide animations, or '?sound=off' to disable sound. You can also adjust duration, position, and font size. Let me show you a few examples..."

### Step 5: Troubleshooting Common Issues (7:00 - 8:30)
**Visual**:
- Show connection status indicators
- Demonstrate common errors
- Show solutions
**Narration**:
"If your widget isn't working, check the connection status indicator in the top-right corner. Green means connected, red means disconnected. Common issues include incorrect URLs, expired tokens, or network problems. If you're having trouble, try refreshing the browser source or regenerating your token."

### Conclusion (8:30 - 9:00)
**Visual**: Show final setup with alerts working
**Narration**:
